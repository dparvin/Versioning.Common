# Versioning.Common

**Versioning.Common** provides a simple, centralized way to manage version numbers across multiple .NET projects using MSBuild. It works both for local development and automated CI builds (e.g., Azure DevOps, GitHub Actions).

## âœ¨ Features

- Automatically sets:
  - `Version`
  - `AssemblyVersion`
  - `FileVersion`
  - `InformationalVersion`
- Supports CI/CD overrides via MSBuild properties (like `BaseVersion` or `BuildMetadata`)
- Clean fallback defaults for local development
- No manual version duplication across projects
- Auto-imported when used as a NuGet package (`.props` and `.targets` support)

## ðŸ“¦ Usage

### 1. Add the Package

```xml
<PackageReference Include="Versioning.Common" Version="1.0.0" />
```

Once added, no further imports are necessary. MSBuild will automatically pick up the .props and .targets files.

### 2. Set Base Version (Optional)

In your .csproj (optional â€” for local development):

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <BaseVersion>2.0.0</BaseVersion>
</PropertyGroup>
```

If you decide you don't want the version info in the build log, you can add this to your project to turn it off:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <LogVersionInfo Condition="'$(LogVersionInfo)' == ''">false</LogVersionInfo>
</PropertyGroup>
```

With that in your project, you can still have it showing in your build pipeline while not showing in Visual Studio.

In your CI build (recommended):

```bash
msbuild /p:BaseVersion=2.0.0 /p:BuildMetadata=beta1
```

### 3. Resulting Versions

```text
MSBuild Property        Example Output
AssemblyVersion         2.0.0.0
FileVersion             2.0.0.0
Version                 2.0.0-beta1
InformationalVersion    2.0.0-beta1
```

## ðŸ›  How It Works

The .props file runs early to initialize version variables.

The .targets file finalizes the version and writes to the build log.

Local builds use BaseVersion; CI builds can override via CLI.

### Build Variables Available

- BaseVersion - The major, minor and patch indicators for the version.
- BuildMetadata - optional version metadata that can identify the build as a beta or release candidate.
- BuildIdentifier - optional data used to specifically identify the build this is from.
- LogVersionInfo - turn on or off the logging of the version information in the build output.  If not set to true, logging will be turned off.

Each of these variables can be set in your project file, and/or supplied by your automated build process.  You can make them work one way in Visual Studio and another in your automated build.

If you are setting versions in your AssemblyInfo file, then you will want to remove those so that the build process will use this process instead.

### ðŸ’¡ Example Build Output

```text
================== Versioning Info ==================
  âž¤ BaseVersion: 2.0.0
  âž¤ BuildMetadata: beta1
  âž¤ BuildIdentifier: build.20250614.shaabc123
  âž¤ AssemblyVersion: 2.0.0.0
  âž¤ FileVersion: 2.0.0.0
  âž¤ Version (NuGet): 2.0.0-beta1
  âž¤ InformationalVersion: 2.0.0-beta1+build.20250614.shaabc123
=====================================================
```
